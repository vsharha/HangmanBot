# HangmanBot

This was my first Discord bot, I decided to go with the topic of Hangman because it is a well-known game that most people know how to play.

## Your bot to play hangman in pairs.

After starting a game with another player using `hm play`, you may get hints using `hm hint`. Canceling a game is possible using <code>hm cancel</code> in case you changed your mind or couldn't find anyone to play with.

Use `hm help` to learn more.
